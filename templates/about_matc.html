	<h3>What is The Manually Annotated Twitter Corpus Project?</h3>
			<p>The Manually Annotated Twitter Corpus Project (a.k.a. The MATC Project) is a crowdsourced part of speech tagging game that results in a corpus of words sourced from Twitter.</p>
			<h4>But what does that even <i>mean</i>?</h4>
				<p>Basically, there's two parts to The MATC Project: <a href="{{url_for('abt_tt')}}">Tres Tigres</a>, and <a href="{{url_for('abt_ttud')}}"><i>The TwitUrban Dictionary</i></a>.</p>
