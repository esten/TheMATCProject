#Welcome to Tres Tigres
###Tres Tigres is a crowdsourced part of speech tagging (POS) game that results in a corpus of words sourced from Twitter. 
This corpus is called The Manually Annotated Twitter Corpus (or the TwitUrban Dictionary). 

None of the words in the TwitUrban Dictionary are POS tagged in Python's Natural Language Toolkit; many are text-speak or neologisms. 

##General Information
Tres Tigres collects all tweets from the sample Public stream via Twitter's streaming API (accessed using the Twython module in Python).
