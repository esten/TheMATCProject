#Welcome to Tres Tigres
###Tres Tigres is a crowdsourced part of speech (POS) tagging game that results in a corpus of words sourced from Twitter. 
This corpus is called The Manually Annotated Twitter Corpus (MATC, or the TwitUrban Dictionary). 

The MATC is freely available for download or other public use, unlike other manually annotated English corpora which include text and internet speak/neologisms. 


##General Information
Tres Tigres collects all tweets from the sample Public stream via Twitter's streaming API (accessed using the Twython module in Python). 

None of the words in the TwitUrban Dictionary are listed in the Wordnik corpus, which pulls from The American Heritage Dictionary, WordNet, Wiktionary, and a variety of other sources.
